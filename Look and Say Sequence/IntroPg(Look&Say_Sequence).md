# A Brief Introduction
For those of you who don't know what a Look and Say Sequence is, it is a number sequence where every new set of numbers added to the sequence describes
the set of numbers added immediately before it. It's much easier to visualize/describe when shown in pyramid form like this one:

You read it like so from top to bottom:
1
One 1
Two 1
One 2 Two 1
One 1 Two 2 One 1
etc.
