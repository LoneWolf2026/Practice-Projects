# Introduction
A Weight Table is a convenient way to approximate how much weight you should use for an exercise. If you could do 3 reps of X at Y (lb/kg), you could probably do 1 rep at a slightly higher weight. This project is an attempt to generate a personalized weight table after taking the user's input using basic Pandas commands.
